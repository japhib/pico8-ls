# PICO-8 Language Server

Full language support for the [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php)
dialect of Lua. 

The goal is to have all the features you'd expect in a full-fledged language
server, such as [the one for Lua](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua),
but specifically tailored for a frictionless PICO-8 experience.

## Feature highlights

View docs on hover, then auto-complete and signature help:

Full support for `#include` statements:

## Features

- Syntax highlighting
- Syntax errors
- Warnings on undefined variable usage
- Find symbol in document
- Go to definition
- Find references
- Hover support & signature help for built-in functions
- Auto-completion
- Support for `#include`ing other files
- Snippets for common idioms (functions, loops, etc) as well as pico-8 symbols (`p8-jelpi` -> üê±, `p8-x-key` -> ‚ùé, etc)
- Code formatting

## Support for other platforms

This extension uses the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/),
so while it's mainly made for VSCode, it could also be used for other editors
such as NeoVim, Atom, etc.

I don't have any experience setting up language extensions for platforms other than VSCode, so currently
looking for help with that. See tips and support thread on the issue for various editors:
- [Neovim](https://github.com/japhib/pico8-ls/issues/34)
- [Sublime Text](https://github.com/japhib/pico8-ls/issues/44)

## Changelog

[Changelog has been moved to a separate file.](https://github.com/japhib/pico8-ls/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Development

Please follow the official [Language Server Extension Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide)
to understand how to develop VS Code language server extension.
